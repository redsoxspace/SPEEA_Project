The company tried to delay the process and dilute our support. We were committed to staying united and supporting each other. Today, facility engineers are part of the SPEEA Professional Unit. We have a voice at work and enjoy the benefits of a contract that guarantees our wages and benefits.</span>"<br> - Steve Karich, Environmental Engineer (Renton, Washington)</td>
