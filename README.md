# SPEEA_Project
Union Website in PHP
We redesigned an obsolete website (www.speea.org) with the PHP framework codeigniter. We also integrated Stripe API for the e-commerce 
store to allow users to purchase clothing if they wished. I was in charge of integrating Stripe along with some of the bootstrap for the 
front end.
